- 👋 Hi, I’m @ctrlaltcookie
- 👀 I’m interested in rabbits, space, making shit people will find helpful
- 🌱 I’m currently learning uh how to make shit people find helpful
- 💞️ I’m looking to make dumb stuff like twitch plays guilty gear
- 📫 How to reach me through my discord, you can find that in all the usual places

i had to make a new github cos my old one would be way to obviously identifying as i worked on open source software, this is all the dumb shit i'm doing for streams, if you don't know me from streaming i stream regularly [on twitch/ctrlaltcookie](twitch.tv/ctrlaltcookie)
and i make [youtube videos too @ctrlaltcookie](youtube.com/@ctrlaltcookie) really i'm everywhere like a plague with ctrlaltcookie as my handle, idk it doesn't matter, good luck using the shit i make in 4 hours on stream lmao

If you'd like to support the not weird and totally normal things i do online [you can become a patron on patreon for just $1.](https://www.patreon.com/funnuibunnui)
